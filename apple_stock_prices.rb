Apple Stocks
You have an array stock_prices_yesterday that contains the value of apple stocks at minute intervals starting at 9:30am.

For example:
stock_prices_yesterday[0] is the price of the stock at 9:30am
stock_prices_yesterday[1] is the price of the stock at 9:31am
stock_prices_yesterday[2] is the price of the stock at 9:32am
etc

Determine the greatest profit you could have made yesterday.

Note that you can't just find the max and min of the array and subtract them becasue you cannot sell stock until you buy it.

What is the time and space complexity of your solution?
